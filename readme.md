# Wisteria

__Wisteria__ is a generic macro for automatic materialization of typeclasses for datatypes composed from product types (e.g. case classes) and coproduct types (e.g. enums). It supports recursively-defined datatypes out-of-the-box, and incurs no significant time-penalty during compilation.

## Features

 - derives typeclasses for case classes, case objects and sealed traits
 - offers a lightweight syntax for writing derivations without needing to understand complex parts of Scala
 - builds upon Scala 3's built-in generic derivation
 - works with recursive and mutually-recursive definitions
 - supports parameterized ADTs (GADTs), including those in recursive types
 - supports typeclasses whose generic type parameter is used in either covariant and contravariant positions


## Getting Started

Given an ADT such as,
```scala
enum Tree[+T]:
  case class Branch(left: Tree[T], right: Tree[T])
  case class Leaf(value: T)
```
and provided an given instance of `Show[Int]` is in scope, and a Wisteria derivation for the `Show` typeclass
has been provided, we can automatically derive given typeclass instances of `Show[Tree[Int]]` on-demand, like
so,
```scala
Branch(Branch(Leaf(1), Leaf(2)), Leaf(3)).show
```
Typeclass authors may provide Wisteria derivations in the typeclass's companion object, but it is easy to create
your own.

The definition of a `Show` typeclass with generic derivation defined with Wisteria might look like this:
```scala
import wisteria.*

trait Show[T]:
  def show(value: T): String

object Show extends Derivation[Show]:
  def join[T](ctx: CaseClass[Show, T]): Show[T] =
    ctx.params.map { p =>
      s"${p.label}=${p.typeclass.show(p.dereference(value))}"
    }.mkString("{", ",", "}")

  override def split[T](ctx: SealedTrait[Show, T]): Show[T] = value =>
    ctx.dispatch(value) { sub => sub.typeclass.show(sub.cast(value))
```

The `Derivation` trait provides a `derived` method which will attempt to construct a corresponding typeclass
instance for the type passed to it. Importing `Show.derived` as defined in the example above will make generic
derivation for `Show` typeclasses available in the scope of the import.

While any object may be used to define a derivation, if you control the typeclass you are deriving for, the
companion object of the typeclass is the obvious choice since it generic derivations for that typeclass will
be automatically available for consideration during contextual search.

## Limitations

Wisteria is not currently able to access default values for case class parameters.


## Status

Wisteria is classified as __maturescent__. Propensive defines the following five stability levels for open-source projects:

- _embryonic_: for experimental or demonstrative purposes only, without guarantee of longevity
- _fledgling_: of proven utility, seeking contributions, but liable to significant redesigns
- _maturescent_: major design decisions broady settled, seeking probatory adoption and refinement of designs
- _dependable_: production-ready, subject to controlled ongoing maintenance and enhancement; tagged as version `1.0` or later
- _adamantine_: proven, reliable and production-ready, with no further breaking changes ever anticipated

## Availability

Wisteria&rsquo;s source is available on GitHub, and may be built with [Fury](https://github.com/propensive/fury) by
cloning the layer `propensive/wisteria`.
```
fury layer clone -i propensive/wisteria
```
or imported into an existing layer with,
```
fury layer import -i propensive/wisteria
```
A binary is available on Maven Central as `com.propensive:wisteria-core_<scala-version>:2.0.0`. This may be added
to an [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) build with:
```
libraryDependencies += "com.propensive" %% "wisteria-core" % "2.0.0"
```
